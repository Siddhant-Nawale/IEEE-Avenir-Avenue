            <h1>The zombie plague spread like a rapid fire. Once again the humans of the past brought out t destruction upon humanity. Everywhere you look you could find the destroyed  Exomions and those horrible creatures eating upon the flesh of others and converting them.
                There were very few surviving groups left on earth. They had to survive solely on their instants and the power of community.<br><br>
                Many years went by, Zombies mutated in to more dangerous beasts, becoming more faster, more gruesome, more stronger, and more savage then the already were. Very few human settlement were left standing and had to suffer hardships every day. <br><br>
                One Day An un-recognized message came on the radio and all the humans were called to the place of origin, the place where all this started. So, after various recon missions the survivors decided to go. All the settlements and started moving towards that place. Then they reached there. There it was a giant globe like thing. It was a space ship.
                Apparently when the outbreak started some humans decided to move to a different planet. Those human came back to take the survivors with them to the new settlement on the planet </h1>
