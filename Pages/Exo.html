                <h1>The time period was around 2060. Humans were discovering new thing. This was the age of the giant beasts called as the Exomions. They were these huge mechanical skeletons for humans to operate.
                    As the earths structure had changed due to the war. these Exomions were mostly used for exploring the earth that was given to them by their ancestor and also looking for wars if there were any, as this was a peaceful era.<br><br>
                    In one of the exploits a grp of people found a laboratory deep inside a cave of the land they called the lands of purgatory. They started exploring the lab. They found it was a lab for human experiment. It was filled with dead rotten bodies of human….and there was a cage in which the was someone so as they thought. So, they opened the cage but it was too late to find out that that "someone" was a living dead. A zombie to be precise…..that creature tore through them, it was doing nothing but converting all of them into one of him and so started the era of zombies
